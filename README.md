Customized supply chain performance dashboard with delivery and revenue insights

This is my customized version of a Power BI dashboard originally inspired by open-source work.  
It analyzes supply chain KPIs like delivery performance, sales trends, and late orders.  
I modified visuals, themes, and structure to make it unique.
